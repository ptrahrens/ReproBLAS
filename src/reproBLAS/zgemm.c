/**
 * @brief Add to complex double precision matrix C the reproducible matrix-matrix product of complex double precision matrices A and B
 *
 * Performs one of the matrix-matrix operations
 *
 *   C := alpha*op(A)*op(B) + beta*C,
 *
 * where  op(X) is one of
 *
 *   op(X) = X   or   op(X) = X**T   or   op(X) = X**H,
 *
 * alpha and beta are scalars, A and B and C are matrices with op(A) an M by K matrix, op(B) a K by N matrix, and C is an M by N matrix.
 *
 * The matrix-matrix product is computed using binned types of default fold with #binnedBLAS_zbzgemm()
 *
 * @param Order a character specifying the matrix ordering ('r' or 'R' for row-major, 'c' or 'C' for column major)
 * @param TransA a character specifying whether or not to transpose A before taking the matrix-matrix product ('n' or 'N' not to transpose, 't' or 'T' to transpose, 'c' or 'C' to conjugate transpose)
 * @param TransB a character specifying whether or not to transpose B before taking the matrix-matrix product ('n' or 'N' not to transpose, 't' or 'T' to transpose, 'c' or 'C' to conjugate transpose)
 * @param M number of rows of matrix op(A) and of the matrix C.
 * @param N number of columns of matrix op(B) and of the matrix C.
 * @param K number of columns of matrix op(A) and columns of the matrix op(B).
 * @param alpha scalar alpha
 * @param A complex double precision matrix of dimension (ma, lda) in row-major or (lda, na) in column-major. (ma, na) is (M, K) if A is not transposed and (K, M) otherwise.
 * @param lda the first dimension of A as declared in the calling program. lda must be at least na in row major or ma in column major.
 * @param B complex double precision matrix of dimension (mb, ldb) in row-major or (ldb, nb) in column-major. (mb, nb) is (K, N) if B is not transposed and (N, K) otherwise.
 * @param ldb the first dimension of B as declared in the calling program. ldb must be at least nb in row major or mb in column major.
 * @param beta scalar beta
 * @param C complex double precision matrix of dimension (M, ldc) in row-major or (ldc, N) in column-major.
 * @param ldc the first dimension of C as declared in the calling program. ldc must be at least N in row major or M in column major.
